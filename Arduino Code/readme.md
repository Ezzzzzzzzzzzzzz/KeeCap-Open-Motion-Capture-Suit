This folder contains all of the arduino code for putting in the arduino for the motion capture suit.

Ok, I'm going to be honest.  I had to skim through the libraries I have in my machine and put links to what I thought this particular piece of code used.  I may try building this on a new machine one day, but for now, here's my best guess on what you need.

To run the above code you need to put the following libraries into your arduino environment:

# Adafruit Unified BNO055 Driver (AHRS/Orientation) #

This driver is for the Adafruit BNO055 Breakout (http://www.adafruit.com/products/2472),
and is based on Adafruit's Unified Sensor Library (Adafruit_Sensor).

## What is the Adafruit Unified Sensor Library? ##

The Adafruit Unified Sensor Library ([Adafruit_Sensor](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Sensor))

# Arduino Button Library

README file  

# Liquid Menu and LIquid Crystal from here:

# May need timer and simple timer not sure.
